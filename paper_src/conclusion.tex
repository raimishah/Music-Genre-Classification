\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion} 

In this paper, we attempt to decrease the overhead caused by state of the art reliability techniques by presenting an instruction criticality formula and a reliable code generation algorithm. We show that instruction criticality is heavily dependent on instruction type, instruction location in control flow and loop index. Then, we present our approach on reliable code generation where current reliability techniques are applied only to most critical instructions.  Our LLVM implementation of this code generation algorithm provides encouraging results as demonstrated by our experiments on MiBench and MediaBench. In the future, we plan to investigate other factors that might affect criticality or fault tolerance of a system such as compiler based error masking or register file criticality. We hope that our discussion and implementation of instruction criticality formula and reliable code generation program can provoke more thorough research to make safety-critical embedding systems more fault tolerance with less overhead.
