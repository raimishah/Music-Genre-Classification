\begin{abstract}
With the increasing number of audio processing applications in the music industry, music genre classification became a very interesting and significant challenge for Music Information Retrieval. Because of the existence of thousands of genres from different cultures and the general subjective nature of music genres, it is very hard to create a system that can classify any type of music to its genre. In this project, we do a comparative study of audio music genre classification where we use different machine learning approaches to classify musical genres. Specifically, we analyze different machine learning algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbor, multi-class SVMs, k-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models. Using each classifier, we additionally create a super classifier that uses the most common predictions from other classifiers. Finally, we also use PyTorch to build convolutional neural networks and perform genre classification with deep learning. We use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features and apply Principcal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract useful information from our dataset. Our experimental results suggest that we can achieve 90\% accuracy for 5 musical genres.
